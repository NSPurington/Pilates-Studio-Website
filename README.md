# Pilates Studio Website

This is a site I'm updating as a freelance web development project to add to my portfolio.  

I'm using HTML, CSS, and jQuery to develop a site that displays the services of a pilates studio in San Diego, CA.

jQuery is primarily used to control the moving images (slideshow) on the homepage.
