<p>Jennifer Curry Wingrove, a STOTT Certified Pilates Instructor and
          renowned Ballerina of the California Ballet Company, initially became
          interested in Pilates to further strengthen her own body for her international
          dancing career. She was so impressed with what Pilates did for her
          that she became inspired to teach and share this form of mindful exercise
          with others. Jennifer's instruction utilizes a dynamic repertoire of
          exercises to emphasize strength, flexibility, and mind-body-spirit
          connection.</p>
        <p class="style4">&quot;Jennifer excels at tuning into the individual and his or her physical idiosyncrasies, selecting a plan that relates to each client, and committing to help them improve their physical, mental, and spiritual well being through Pilates as a platform for overall health.&quot; - Nancy Daly, client.</p>
        <p>Jennifer has 25 years experience of teaching ballet and 10 years of
          teaching Pilates in the San Diego area. Her clients include the California
          Ballet Company, San Diego Symphony, and Old Globe Theater. She is also
          a Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist, a professional ballet coach &amp; teacher,
          and has a B.A. in Psychology from the University of California, San
          Diego.</p>
