She began her Pilates training in 2000, while dancing with the State Street Ballet in Santa Barbara, CA. Finding Pilates to be invaluably beneficial to her professional dancing career, Laura continued to incorporate the method into her daily training regiment. In 2010, after dancing in San Francisco for ten years, she moved to New York City to dance with the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company. It was in NYC, where Laura completed her 650-hour Comprehensive Pilates certification through Power Pilates. Laura was fortunate to teach for a wide variety of institutions while living in NYC, including Equinox, Google, Power Pilates, Harvard Club, and dance intensives at the Joffrey Ballet School and Lar Lubovitch Dance. Laura is excited to bring her knowledge and experience to sunny San Diego!</p>       </div>    <div class="instructor-img">        <img src="../images/Instructors/jennifer_bearse.jpg">    </div>    <div class="Instructors">      <p>Born and raised in Massachusetts, outdoor sports and my love to challenge myself physically have shaped my complete devotion and love for exercise and healthy living. After suffering from a debilitating hip and back injury in 2008 caused by years of heavy endurance training and pounding on my body that caused muscle imbalances, lack of stability, and a host of other problems, I discovered Pilates and soon thereafter delved into the rigorous 500+hour teaching certification through Balanced Body University. Since 2009, I have inspired, healed and educated both individuals and groups using the Pilates Method.      I am an avid athlete with an extensive background in a multitude of athletic disciplines including: CrossFit, triathlons, cycling, running, weight training, skiing, hiking, yoga, and the Brazilian martial art Capoeira. I am a multi-time triathlon finisher, and an Ironman Triathlete, and have competed in all types of endurance events, including long and short course triathlons, duathlons, century bike rides, and multiple half marathons and 10k running races.      I am currently enjoying increasing my CrossFit skills and abilities, and have been focused on combining the tenants of CrossFit with my knowledge of core strength and body awareness. It is truly powerful, and is inspiring me to see the power of the Pilates method in enhancing my abilities as a CrossFit athlete, and has reinvigorated my commitment to inspiring people to push themselves harder and transform their bodies, mentally and physically, through the Pilates Method and beyond.      I come to the Pilates Method from the perspective of an athlete and someone who has suffered from chronic pain. I myself have experienced the benefits of using Pilates to rehabilitate my body and become pain-free, while at the same time experiencing its’ benefits as a tool for creating a strong, flexible, and lean body. My goal when working with clients is to help clients to use all of the elements of the Pilates Method in their daily lives and in other activities, so that they can prevent future injuries and move with intelligence and total body awareness, no matter what their athletic or fitness goals are.      There is nothing more fulfilling than helping others change for the positive, and sharing this knowledge and skill with them, whether it’s taking away their back pain, making them stand and walk taller, or just making them smile about the progress they make; that to me is powerful. And that is why I’m committed to doing what I do.</p>    </div>        <div class="instructor-img">        <img src="../images/Instructors/bernadette_torres.jpg">    </div>    <div class="Instructors">      <p>Bernadette began dancing Ballet at the age of six. During her ballet school years, she attended several summer intensive programs for Ballet, Contemporary, and Modern dance including, Pacific Northwest Ballet, American Ballet Theatre (New York), Houston Ballet (where she was offered a year round scholarship), and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. Additionally, Bernadette was offered a spot as a trainee with the Joffrey Ballet, in Chicago. She also competed in the final rounds at the Youth America Grand Prix Competition in New York, and the World Ballet Competition in Orlando, Florida. At the age of seventeen, Bernadette signed her first professional ballet contract. Moving through the ranks quickly, she performed several soloist and principal roles. She has toured across the United States and Europe as a guest artist for several International Galas. Bernadette is the proud recipient of two European Dance awards. In addition, original works have been created on Bernadette by Lorin Johnson (former ABT dancer), Ryan Beck (where she partnered with Daniel Baker from Season 9 of SYTYCD), and Greg Sample (former Hubbard Street Dance Chicago dancer). Currently, Bernadette performs nationally and internationally as a guest Principal Artist, teaches Master Ballet Classes at various studios and academies, is a professional ballet coach, choreographer, and occasionally a competition judge. Bernadette was introduced to Pilates while attending the many different summer intensive programs. She fully embraced Pilates about four years ago, when she began taking classes with owner Jennifer Curry Wingrove at Pilates on Park. During that time, she developed an interest and began to pursue her own Pilates certification. Having completed the BASI (Body Arts and Science International) Pilates training under BASI founder Rael Isacowitz, she is currently finishing her practice hours to become a fully certified BASI Pilates instructor. Bernadette has welcomed Pilates into her lifestyle as a form of cross training for her professional dance career. She has felt a great difference within her body since incorporating Pilates training, weekly, and loves seeing the same difference in those she teaches. Outside of the studio, Bernadette attends SDSU and is in her senior year working toward her BS in Business Administration with emphasis in Management and a minor in Marketing.</p>      </div>  </div></body></html>
